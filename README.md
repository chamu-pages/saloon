# Lumina | Luxury Salon Demo

### High-Performance Static Demo by Chamu Pages

This repository contains the source code for "Lumina," a concept website designed for a luxury salon and beauty clinic based in Beverly Hills, CA. 

This project serves as a portfolio demonstration for **Chamu Pages**, showcasing how service-based businesses can achieve a premium, high-end digital aesthetic without relying on bloated, slow-loading site builders.

## Project Objective

The goal of this demo is to prove that luxury branding and elite technical performance are not mutually exclusive. By utilizing a static web architecture, this site delivers instant load times and optimal security, engineered specifically to convert high-ticket clients.

## Technical Architecture

This is a "Zero-Build" Static Website. It does not require a complex build process (like Node.js or Webpack) and can be hosted directly as a folder. This "Direct-to-Code" approach bypasses heavy databases and plugins to ensure maximum efficiency and a 100/100 Google Lighthouse speed score.

### Core Stack
* **Structure:** Semantic HTML5
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v3 (via CDN)
* **Interactivity:** Alpine.js v3 (via CDN)
* **SEO/Metadata:** JSON-LD Schema, Open Graph (OG), and Twitter Cards
* **Local Files:** robots.txt, sitemap.xml, llms.txt

## Key Features

* **Conversion-Focused Layout:** Strategic placement of "Book Your Consultation" calls-to-action.
* **Service Menu Architecture:** Clean, scannable pricing tables for high-end services.
* **Media Optimization:** Highly compressed gallery assets to maintain visual fidelity without sacrificing load speed.
* **Mobile-First Responsive Design:** Flawless scaling from mobile devices to ultrawide desktop monitors.

## Local Development

Because this is a zero-build project using CDNs for styling and interactivity, no heavy package installations are required.
